// YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOVE THIS POINT

// Take small steps! Don't write a for loop and two functions that do all of the calculations right away.
// This problem is massive! Break the problem down. Use the debugger.
// What is the fewest lines of code I can write and test to get just a little closer?

// This is not a race. Everyone on your team should understand what is happening.
// Ask questions when you don't.


// 1. create array for new objects
    // loop on employees, (create function) creating new obj for each employee, (create function) for bonus calculation
    // add it to array
let bonuses = [];

for (employee of employees) {
  // calc bonus %
  // create new object
  let bonus = {
      name: employee.name,
      bonusPercentage: //result of bonus calculation
      totalCompensation: //result
      totalBonus://result
  }//new object
  // push to new array
  bonuses.push(bonus);
